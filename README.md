## Management Client: GUI
![screenshot](.github/screenshot.png)

The client (both GUI and CLI) supports Kerberos authentication which means that you can use the client without entering a password if you are logged in with a domain account. If not, NTLM authentication is used as fallback and the client will ask you for username and password.

It is highly recommended to turn on SSL in the config file (`~/.laps-client.json`) if your LDAP server has a valid certificate (set `ssl` to `true` and `port` to `636`). You can also configure multiple LDAP server in the config file.

## Runner
The runner is responsible for automatically changing the admin password of a Linux client and updating it in the LDAP directory. This assumes that Kerberos and Samba is installed and that the machine is already joined to your domain (using `net ads join`).

The runner should be called periodically via cron. It decides by the expiration time stored in the LDAP directory when the password should be changed.
```
*** /etc/cron.hourly/laps-runner ***

#!/bin/sh
/usr/sbin/laps-runner --config /etc/laps-runner.json
```

Please configure the server name etc. by editing the configuration file `/etc/laps-runner.json`.

You can call the runner with the `-f` parameter to force updating the password directly after installation. You should do this to check if the runner is working properly.
